[0.1.0] Initial release                                             07-Nov-2012
 - Includes substantial infrastructure for defining and invoking arbitrary
   commands, either via the command-line, or via a YAML-based .hfm command
   file.
 - Implementations of commands for Calculation, Document Management, and
   Metadata loads / extracts.


[0.2.0] Process Management Support                                  16-Nov-2012
- Implementation of all process management commands for both process units and
  phased submission groups.


[0.3.0] Extended Analytics Support                                  30-Nov-2012
- Implementation of relational and flat file data extracts using Extended
  Analytics.
- Support for encrypted passwords.

[0.3.1] Bug fixes for Calculation commands                          03-Dec-2012
- Fix bugs introduced to the Calculate module in 0.3.0, due to the adoption of
  Slice for POV combination generation in place of Linq.


[0.4.0] Builds for specific HFM versions                            13-Dec-2012
- Due to differences in the type libraries between versions of HFM, it became
  clear that different builds of HFMCmd would be required for each major version
  of HFM, at least under .NET 3.5. Under .NET 4.0, the introduction of the new
  dynamic type functionality provides a possible solution using late-binding of
  COM methods, but this is not yet functional in this release.
- Added an interactive shell mode of operation; to access, just start HFMCmd
  without any parameters. This will drop you at a hfm> prompt, where you can
  then enter commands interactively.


[0.5.0] Bug fixes, HFM 11.1.2.2.300 and HFM 11.1.2.3 compatibility  15-May-2014
- Fixes for all reported issues. Many of these were related to compatibility
  with HFM 11.1.2.2.300, which broke backwards compatibility in a new way, by
  changing the number of arguments to the function CreateStarSchemaExtDim.
  This change is even worse than changing the vtable ordering, since even a
  recompile against the new libraries was insufficient to allow HFMCmd to work!
- Introduced new compile-time and run-time version checks. This should at least
  make it more obvious when HFMCmd is being used with an incompatible version of
  HFM.
- Fixed bug with passing a list of member specifications to commands that accept
  a list of members.
- Add colour to HFMCmd console output. Helps to draw attention to warnings and
  errors.
- Add examples directory, and include a series of examples showing how a sample
  application can be created from scratch using HFMCmd.
