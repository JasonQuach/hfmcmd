# Contributing

Issues that identify bugs, and patches that fix bugs or implement new features
are most welcome!

However, there are a few guidelines I would ask you to follow, to make it easier
for me to merge your contributions.

1. Submitting Issues

    Please include the following:
    * The version and build of HFM you are running. This can be obtained by running:
      HFMCmd GetHFMBuild
    * The HFMCmd version you are running. This can be found by right-clicking on
      HFMCmd, selecting Properties, and clicking on the Version tab.
    * A stack trace with us much detail as possible.
    * The simplest possible reproduction you can.


2. Contributing a fix or enhancement

    If you have a fix for an issue, or an enhancement to functionality:
    * Fork the repo, create a topic branch, and include only those changes related to
      a single issue or enhancement. If you have multiple changes, please submit these
      as separate pull requests.
    * Please add a detailed commit message.
    * Send in the pull request.
    * Follow up with a comment on the ticket if I haven't merged or commented in a few
      days.

Thank you!
