HFMCmd is a command-line tool for performing or automating operations in Oracle
Hyperion Financial Management (HFM). It provides a command-line interface for
performing a wide range of repetitive and/or bulk operations on an HFM
application in a simple manner, and facilitates lights out automation of HFM.

HFMCmd uses the published HFM API to perform operations against an HFM
application, but it provides more than just a thin wrapper over the HFM API.
For example, where an API function might operate on a single item (e.g. the
Consolidate API function takes a single Scenario / Year / Entity combination),
the corresponding HFMCmd command will typically accept a collection of members
for each dimension, and automatically manage the looping over each combination.

In this manner, bulk operations can be performed quickly and easily on large
numbers of scenarios, entities, etc.


== Running HFMCmd

HFMCmd supports two modes of operation:
- A single command can be entered on the command-line, along with
  all of the options it requires as keyword arguments, e.g.

      HFMCmd.exe Consolidate UserName:admin Password:password ClusterName:PROD
          AppName:IFRS Scenario:Actual Year:2008 Periods:May-July Entity:GROUP

- Commands can be read from a command-file, e.g.

      HFMCmd.exe consolidate.hfm

  Contents of consolidate.hfm:

      SetLogonInfo:
        UserName: admin
        Password: password

      OpenApplication:
        ClusterName: PROD
        AppName: IFRS

      Consolidate:
        Scenario: Actual
        Year: 2008
        Periods: May-July
        Entity: GROUP
