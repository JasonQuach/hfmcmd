{"body":"# HFMCmd\r\n\r\nHFMCmd is a command-line tool for performing or automating operations in Oracle\r\nHyperion Financial Management (HFM). It provides a command-line interface for\r\nperforming a wide range of repetitive and/or bulk operations on an HFM\r\napplication in a simple manner, and facilitates lights out automation of HFM.\r\n\r\nHFMCmd uses the published HFM API to perform operations against an HFM\r\napplication, but it provides more than just a thin wrapper over the HFM API:\r\n- Where an API function might operate on a single item (e.g. the\r\n  Consolidate API function takes a single Scenario / Year / Entity combination),\r\n  the corresponding command in HFMCmd will typically accept a collection of members\r\n  for each dimension, and automatically manage the looping over each combination.\r\n- Most commands with a large number of parameters provide sensible defaults for\r\n  many parameters. You can consult the online help to determine which parameters\r\n  are required, and which have default values.\r\n- Long-running operations provide progress bars that provide feedback as the\r\n  operation completes.\r\n- Substitution variables can be defined (or environment variables can be used),\r\n  and can then be used virtually anywhere in a command.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, bulk operations can be performed quickly and easily on large\r\nnumbers of scenarios, entities, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Available Commands\r\n\r\nThe available commands are continuously being added to, but already there are\r\ncommands available for performing most operations associated with:\r\n* Metadata management (e.g. loading / extracting metadata, rules, etc)\r\n* Calculation, consolidation, translation, etc\r\n* Process management (starting, promoting, rejecting, submitting, approving etc)\r\n* Document management (e.g. loading / extracting web forms, reports, etc)\r\n\r\nTo see a complete list of available commands, run:\r\n\r\n    HFMCmd Help Commands\r\n\r\nTo get detailed help for a specific command, use:\r\n\r\n    HFMCmd Help <CommandName>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Downloading Pre-Built Binaries\r\n\r\nHFMCmd supports 2 different builds, one for .NET 3.5 and one for .NET 4.0.\r\nFunctionally, the two builds are identical; the only difference is the size of\r\nthe executable, and the required version of the .NET framework. Most machines\r\nwill already have .NET 3.5 installed, so pick that version if you are unsure.\r\n\r\nPre-built binaries are available at https://github.com/agardiner/hfmcmd/downloads.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nHFMCmd is built as a single standalone .EXE file; no installation is required,\r\nsimply unzip it to a directory somewhere, and it is ready to run.\r\n\r\n### Pre-Requisites\r\n\r\nHFMCmd does require an existing installation of the .NET framework, as already\r\ndescribed. It also requires at least a client installation of HFM on the machine\r\nwhere it is to run.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running HFMCmd\r\n\r\nHFMCmd supports two modes of operation:\r\n\r\n1.  A single command can be entered on the command-line, along with\r\n    all of the options it requires as keyword arguments, e.g.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      HFMCmd.exe Consolidate UserName:admin Password:password ClusterName:PROD\r\n          AppName:IFRS Scenario:Actual Year:2008 Periods:May-July Entity:GROUP\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2.  Commands can be read from a command-file, e.g.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      HFMCmd.exe consolidate.hfm\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Contents of consolidate.hfm:\r\n\r\n    ```yaml\r\n      SetLogonInfo:\r\n        UserName: admin\r\n        Password: password\r\n\r\n      OpenApplication:\r\n        ClusterName: PROD\r\n        AppName: IFRS\r\n\r\n      Consolidate:\r\n        Scenario: Actual\r\n        Year: 2008\r\n        Periods: May-July\r\n        Entity: GROUP\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supported Versions of HFM\r\n\r\nHFMCmd has been designed to work with multiple different versions of HFM, and\r\nshould work with versions 9.3 through to 11.1.2.2, including support for the new\r\nextended dimensionality in 11.1.2.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nHFMCmd is open source software, licenced under a BSD-style licence. That means\r\nit is free to use or modify by anyone for any purpose - but no responsibility is\r\ntaken for any bugs, issues or losses that may arise in the use of the software.\r\nSee the LICENCE file for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issues / Bugs / Feature Requests\r\n\r\nIf you do identify an issue, bug, or missing feature, you can log an Issue at\r\nhttps://github.com/agardiner/hfmcmd/issues. There is no guarantee your issue\r\nwill be addressed, but you have a better chance if you log an issue and provide\r\nclear and concise details.\r\n\r\n","google":"","tagline":"A command-line interface for Hyperion Financial Management","name":"HFMCmd","note":"Don't delete this file!
